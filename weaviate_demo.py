# **Weaviate**

# **Step 1: Install and Run Weaviate**
#    - You can run Weaviate using Docker:
#      ```bash
#      docker run -d -p 8080:8080 semitechnologies/weaviate
#      ```

# **Step 2: Install Weaviate Python Client**
#    - Run the following command to install the Weaviate client:
#      ```bash
#      pip install weaviate-client

# Purpose: This demo shows how to use Weaviate, a vector database, to power our bank's financial chatbot.
# We store sample transactions (e.g., credit card payments) with embeddings (numerical codes capturing meaning)
# and use vector search to find transactions similar to a customer's query, like "Customer used credit card for payment."
# The similarity scores help the chatbot retrieve the most relevant transactions for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

# Import Weaviate to manage our vector database for the bank's chatbot.
import weaviate

# Import Weaviate classes (as wvc) for database setup tools.
import weaviate.classes as wvc

# Import SentenceTransformer to turn text into embeddings (numerical codes).
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Import warnings to manage Python warning messages.
import warnings

# Ignore ResourceWarning messages to keep demo output clean.
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=ResourceWarning)
